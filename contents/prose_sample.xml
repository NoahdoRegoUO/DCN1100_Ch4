        <p>
          <placeName type="city">London</placeName>. <seg type="holiday">Michaelmas</seg> term lately over, and the Lord Chancellor sitting
          in <placeName type="building">Lincoln's Inn Hall</placeName>. Implacable November weather. As much mud in
          the streets as if the waters had but newly retired from the face of
          the earth, and it would not be wonderful to meet a Megalosaurus,
          forty feet long or so, waddling like an elephantine lizard up <placeName type="street">Holborn
          Hill</placeName>. Smoke lowering down from chimney-pots, making a soft black
          drizzle, with flakes of soot in it as big as full-grown
          snowflakes--gone into mourning, one might imagine, for the death of
          the sun. Dogs, undistinguishable in mire. Horses, scarcely better;
          splashed to their very blinkers. Foot passengers, jostling one
          another's umbrellas in a general infection of ill temper, and losing
          their foot-hold at street-corners, where tens of thousands of other
          foot passengers have been slipping and sliding since the day broke
          (if this day ever broke), adding new deposits to the crust upon crust
          of mud, sticking at those points tenaciously to the pavement, and
          accumulating at compound interest.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Fog everywhere. Fog up the river, where it flows among green aits and
          meadows; fog down the river, where it rolls defiled among the tiers
          of shipping and the waterside pollutions of a great (and dirty) city.
          Fog on the <placeName type="town">Essex</placeName> marshes, fog on the <placeName type="town">Kentish</placeName> heights. Fog creeping
          into the cabooses of <seg corresp="#note1">collier-brigs</seg>; fog lying out on the yards and
          hovering in the rigging of great ships; fog drooping on the gunwales
          of barges and small boats. Fog in the eyes and throats of ancient
          <placeName type="town">Greenwich</placeName> pensioners, wheezing by the firesides of their wards; fog
          in the stem and bowl of the afternoon pipe of the wrathful skipper,
          down in his close cabin; fog cruelly pinching the toes and fingers of
          his shivering little <seg corresp="#note2">'prentice</seg> boy on deck. Chance people on the
          bridges peeping over the parapets into a nether sky of fog, with fog
          all round them, as if they were up in a balloon and hanging in the
          misty clouds.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Gas looming through the fog in divers places in the streets, much as
          the sun may, from the spongey fields, be seen to loom by husbandman
          and ploughboy. Most of the shops lighted two hours before their
          time--as the gas seems to know, for it has a haggard and unwilling
          look.
