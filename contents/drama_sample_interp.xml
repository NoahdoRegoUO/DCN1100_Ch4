        <p>Gwendolen--Cecily--it is very painful for me to be forced to speak the truth. It is the
          first time in my life that I have ever been reduced to such a painful position, and I am
          really quite inexperienced in doing anything of the kind. However, I will tell you quite
          frankly that I have no brother Ernest. I have no brother at all. I never had a brother in
          my life, and I certainly have not the smallest intention of ever having one in the
          future.</p>

        <p>I am afraid it is quite clear, Cecily, that neither of us is engaged to be married to any
          one.</p>

        <p>It is not a very pleasant position for a young girl suddenly to find herself in. Is

        <p>Let us go into the house. They will hardly venture to come after us there. We will <seg ana="#vengeful">make sure that they get their comeuppance -- swift justice is the only way</seg>, wouldn't you say?</p>
